# Polymorphism in Python

## Introduction
Polymorphism is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that allows a single function, method, or operator to work in different ways depending on the context. It enhances flexibility and code reusability.

## Types of Polymorphism
- **Method Overloading** (Not directly supported in Python)  
- **Method Overriding**  
- **Operator Overloading**  
- **Duck Typing**  

## Topics to Learn
- Implementing method overriding in derived classes  
- Exploring function and class polymorphism
